# Overview

This repository houses the source code for my portfolio website. The application is deployed to **Netlify** as a staticly-served HTML page generated from a **React (Vite)** build. The site provides relevant details on my career as a web developer and gives an overview of some of the projects that I've undertaken. Many of the effects you find in the site are made using a combination of **Tailwind and Motion.** For more information on these tools, see the *Relevant Links* section below.
